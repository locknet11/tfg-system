# Specification Quality Checklist: Unix Agent Self-Destruction & Self-Cleanup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Content Quality: the spec's WHAT/WHY is technology-agnostic. Specific stack references (GraalVM, `agents/unix`, script/template boundary) appear **only** in the "Constitution Notes" section as required by repo governance, not in requirements or success criteria.
- Three open questions are deliberately recorded in Constitution Notes for the planning phase (failed-auth threshold, mid-plan deletion behavior, binary self-removal mechanism) rather than left as in-line [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers, since each has a reasonable conservative default and does not block spec approval.
